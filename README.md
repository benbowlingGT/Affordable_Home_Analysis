# Affordable Home Analysis

## Background

This project seeks to better understand what affects the affordability of homes in states of the US.


## Analysis


In our analysis of over 5,926 homes across 11 different states and territories, we found that the average sale price for homes varied greatly between states. The most expensive state was Massachusetts, with an average sale price of $589,880, while the most affordable state was Puerto Rico, with an average sale price of $313,148. Pennsylvania, which accounted for 33.5% of the homes in the data set, had an average sale price of $356,104.

When looking at the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in each state, we found that New Jersey had the highest average number of bedrooms at 3.7, while Rhode Island had the highest average number of bathrooms at 2.8. When considering the relationship between home size and price, we found that the larger the home, the higher the purchase price. The correlation between average home size and average sale price was 0.45, which suggests a moderate positive relationship. In Pennsylvania, the same relationship was observed, with the larger the square footage, the higher the sales price.

Based on our findings, the best state to live in based on home size and price would be New Jersey, with an average sale price of $453,337 for a 2,323 square foot home. However, it's worth noting that Massachusetts had the lowest square footage with the highest purchase price at $589,880 for a 1,799 square foot home, which serves as an outlier. Further analysis could be done to determine why this is the case and to determine if there are any other outliers in the data set. Overall, these findings provide valuable information for the mortgage company and can be used to inform their decisions and strategies.
