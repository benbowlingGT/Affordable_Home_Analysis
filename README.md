# Affordable Home Analysis

## Background

This project seeks to better understand what affects the affordability of homes in states of the US.

## Jupyter Notebook

To conduct this analysis, we used Jupyter Notebook, a powerful open-source platform for data analysis and scientific computing. We started by reviewing over 90,000 rows of data related to homes in 11 different states and territories. To make the data more manageable, we cleared any duplicate data, reducing the row count to just over 20,000.

Next, we used Jupyter Notebook to clear out any missing values (NAN) and to bring the row count down to 5,926. We then used Jupyter's built-in functionality to calculate various statistics, such as the average sale price for homes in each state and the average number of bedrooms and bathrooms. We also used Jupyter's data visualization tools to create plots and charts to help us better understand the relationships between variables, such as the relationship between home size and price.

Using Jupyter Notebook allowed us to quickly and efficiently process the data and uncover insights into the affordability of homes in different states and the relationship between the size of a house and its price. The ability to interact with the data and visualize the results in real-time made it easy to iterate on our analysis and arrive at our findings.


## Analysis


In our analysis of over 5,926 homes across 11 different states and territories, we found that the average sale price for homes varied greatly between states. The most expensive state was Massachusetts, with an average sale price of $589,880, while the most affordable state was Puerto Rico, with an average sale price of $313,148. Pennsylvania, which accounted for 33.5% of the homes in the data set, had an average sale price of $356,104.

When looking at the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in each state, we found that New Jersey had the highest average number of bedrooms at 3.7, while Rhode Island had the highest average number of bathrooms at 2.8. When considering the relationship between home size and price, we found that the larger the home, the higher the purchase price. The correlation between average home size and average sale price was 0.45, which suggests a moderate positive relationship. In Pennsylvania, the same relationship was observed, with the larger the square footage, the higher the sales price.

Based on our findings, the best state to live in based on home size and price would be New Jersey, with an average sale price of $453,337 for a 2,323 square foot home. However, it's worth noting that Massachusetts had the lowest square footage with the highest purchase price at $589,880 for a 1,799 square foot home, which serves as an outlier. Further analysis could be done to determine why this is the case and to determine if there are any other outliers in the data set. Overall, these findings provide valuable information for the mortgage company and can be used to inform their decisions and strategies.
